# Production cell Proof of Concept

The Proof of Concept built using IOTA Tangle.

The production cell consists out of
- robot which consume and recuperate energy (during delay phase)
- photovoltaic energy module (PV) which generate energy
- battery which consumes energy if there is an oversupply by the robots or PV and gives the
energy back if there is demand
- public grid which supplies alternating current (AC)
